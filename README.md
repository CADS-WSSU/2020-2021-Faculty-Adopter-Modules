# Data-Science-Modules

This is a repository compiling the data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions.
